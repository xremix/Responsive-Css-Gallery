# responsive-css-gallery
Samples for a Web Gallery based on different approaches (Flexbox, CSS3 Column, Bootstrap, etc.)

##Status
WIP
-[ ] Basic HTML
-[ ] CSS3 Flexbox
-[ ] CSS3 Column
-[ ] Bootstrap Basic
-[ ] Bootstrap Advanced

##Goal
I strugled with most available Galleries out beacuse I wanted a really **lightweight**, **responsive**, **CSS-only** gallery that I can customize from it's styling.
The gallery should work on **comon browsers** and just **look high-value** without having any unnecessary animations or gaps between the images.
I decided for showing the images in columns - rows would also be fine but that could make portrait images look small and nonrelevant.
Also I took a look at other web galleries out and how they display the single images. My personal favorite was Flickr as it is exactly what I am searching for.
